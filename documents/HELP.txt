Here's a step-by-step guide to deploy our project build with Next.js:

1.Install dependencies
  Run npm install or yarn in your project folder to install all dependencies.

2.Build the project
  Run npm run build or yarn build to generate the .next build folder.

3.Choose a deployment platform
  You can deploy to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, Render, or your own server.

Deployment on Vercel:

1.Go to vercel.com and sign in with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.

2.Click on "Add New Project" and import your Next.js repository.

3.Configure the settings (if needed), usually defaults work fine.

4.Click "Deploy" and Vercel will build and host your site.

Deployment on your own server (Node.js hosting):

1.On your server, install Node.js (version 18+ recommended).

2.Copy the project folder or clone the repository from Git.

3.Install the dependencies with npm install.

4.Build the app using npm run build.

5.Start the server with npm start (this uses the next start command).

6.Make sure port 3000 is open or configure your firewall
